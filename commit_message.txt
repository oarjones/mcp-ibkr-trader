feat: Implement additional refinements and new tests

This commit includes the following refinements and new tests:

- **Pacing rules (hist√≥ricos) in `tws_client.py`:**
    - Added `_hist_lock` and `_last_hist` module-level variables.
    - Implemented `_pace_hist` function to enforce a minimum gap between historical data requests.
    - Called `_pace_hist()` before `reqHistoricalData` in `TWSClient.get_historical_data`.

- **`historicalDataEnd` without monkey-patching in `tws_client.py`:**
    - Modified `TWSClient` to use `self._end_events` (a dictionary of `threading.Event` objects) for managing historical data request completion.
    - Updated `get_historical_data` to use this event-based synchronization.
    - Modified `historicalDataEnd` to set the corresponding `threading.Event` when data ends.

- **Dynamic duration with start/end in `ib_hist_params`:**
    - Implemented `_ib_duration_from_range` function in `ibkr_adapter/adapter.py` to calculate `durationStr` dynamically.
    - Modified `ib_hist_params` to use this new function.

- **`resolve_contract` for FX and STK:**
    - Verified existing implementation in `ibkr_adapter/mapping.py` already meets requirements.

- **Transmit flags in bracket orders:**
    - Verified `make_bracket_order` in `ibkr_adapter/tws_client.py` already sets `transmit` flags correctly.

- **`useRTH` configurable:**
    - Modified `TWSClient.get_historical_data` to accept `useRTH` as a parameter.
    - Modified `TWSAdapter.get_bars` to pass `useRTH` from config or method parameter.

- **`get_positions_blocking`:**
    - Modified `TWSClient.get_positions_blocking` in `ibkr_adapter/tws_client.py` to include `currency` and `unrealized_pnl` in the output.

- **`DRY_RUN` deterministic:**
    - Modified `TWSAdapter.get_bars` and `TWSAdapter.place_bracket_order` in `ibkr_adapter/adapter.py` to use deterministic `random.seed()` for reproducible mock data.

- **New tests:**
    - Added `tests/test_enhancements.py` with new tests for pacing, dynamic duration, FX contract mapping, bracket transmit flags, and positions blocking shape.
