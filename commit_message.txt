feat: Implement nits and micro-improvements

This commit implements the following nits and micro-improvements:

- **Thread-safety for event dictionary (`tws_client.py`):**
    - Added `_events_lock` to protect accesses to `self._end_events`.

- **Cleanup in timeouts/errors (`tws_client.py`):**
    - Ensured `self._end_events` entry is removed and associated queue is drained in a `finally` block when `cancelHistoricalData(reqId)` is called due to timeout.

- **Queues with size (`tws_client.py`):**
    - Defined `Queue(maxsize=100)` for each `reqId`.

- **Unsubscriptions/teardown (`tws_client.py`):**
    - Added a comment in `disconnect()` to remind about implementing cancellation of real-time data subscriptions.

- **Normalization FX/STK (`ibkr_adapter/mapping.py`):**
    - Verified existing implementation already meets requirements.

- **Types/dtypes in `get_bars` (`ibkr_adapter/adapter.py`):**
    - Ensured `df.dtypes` are numeric (`float64`/`int64`) and `ts` is `tz-naive` or `UTC` consistent in `get_bars`.

- **Friendly IB errors (`tws_client.py`):**
    - Added `IBKRError` custom exception and `IBKR_ERROR_MAP` for common error codes.
    - Modified the `error` method to use this mapping for friendlier messages.

- **RTH/Outside RTH documentation (`README.md`):**
    - Documented in `README.md` that `outside_rth: true` implies `useRTH=0`.
